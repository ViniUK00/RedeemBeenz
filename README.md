# Redeem Beenz – Applied Software Engineering Assignment

## Overview
This project is a **C# console application** developed as part of the **Applied Software Engineering** module coursework.

The application implements a *Redeem Beenz* use case based on the Hill & Knowlton knowledge management system case study. It demonstrates the application of **software engineering principles**, **UML-driven design**, **Object Constraint Language (OCL)**, **unit testing**, and **component-based architecture**.

The system allows an employee to:
- View their beenz balance
- Browse a reward catalogue
- Redeem rewards using accumulated beenz
- Enforce formal business rules and constraints

## Key Features
- Console-based interactive application
- Object-oriented design with clear separation of concerns
- Component-based architecture using interfaces
- OCL-style preconditions, postconditions, and invariants enforced at runtime
- Unit testing with **NUnit**
- In-memory data stores for simplicity and testability

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET
- **Testing:** NUnit
- **Design:** UML, OCL
- **Architecture:** Component-based, Interface-driven design
